# Challenge week 1 git
- Create a file in master and a branch named bootcamp, modify
the file to create a conflict between the two branches and resolve the conflict.

- Generate a gitignore file to ignore the unnecessary files like the build folder

## Create a gitignore file
There are many ways to create a gitignore file, the best practice is create one in the root project, but in this time I will create one locally because in the challenge says that. To do that I used the page [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io) and generated a gitignore file of java and gradle locally.

## Conflict
The conflict will be in the merge of two files, where I need save a fragment of each one.
